Hello do this if you want this to compactible to 000webhost

1. in koneksi.php change the entire code to this:
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "id20933359_export";
$pass = "PBL=semester3";
$db = "id20933359_exportandimportdata";

$koneksi = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pass, $db);
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
    die("Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>

2. Add id20933359_exportandimportdata.sql in the folder to you phpmyadmin

3. lastly add this line in .htaccess
php_flag output_buffering on
please do not attempt to modify or remove this line `php_value display_errors 1`
in the .htaccess file
